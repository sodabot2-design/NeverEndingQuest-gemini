KLING AI PROMPT:
Massive 40-foot serpentine monster undulating forward, brilliant blue scales crackling with electrical energy. Lightning arcs between its two curved horns and courses down entire length. Twelve legs move in rippling sequence allowing shocking speed. The dragon-like head rears up, mouth opening as electrical breath weapon builds, throat glowing blue-white. Electricity arcs to nearby surfaces. The creature coils and strikes with serpentine grace. Photorealistic detail with smooth consistent motion, dynamic lightning effects, and unique horror of snake with legs.
