============================================================

KLING AI PROMPT:
Eight-legged reptilian monster advancing with unsettling spider-like gait, dark green scales with brown mottling. Its pale yellow eyes glow with sickly light - the deadly gaze that turns victims to stone. The creature's broad flat head sways as it moves, crown of small horns catching light. Mouth opens slightly showing rows of sharp teeth. Behind it, partially petrified victims frozen mid-scream. Heavy tail drags leaving furrows. Photorealistic detail with smooth consistent motion, hypnotic eye glow, and deadly reptilian menace.
