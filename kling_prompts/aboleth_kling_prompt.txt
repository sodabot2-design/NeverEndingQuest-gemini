============================================================

KLING AI PROMPT:
Ancient fish-like horror floating in dark underwater cavern, its three red eyes pulsing with alien intelligence. Four massive tentacles writhe and coil through murky water, dripping thick mucus. The creature's rubbery gray-green skin glistens as bioluminescent fungi cast eerie light across its bulk. It moves forward slowly, tentacles reaching toward viewer, mouth opening to reveal rows of needle teeth. Water ripples around its massive form. Photorealistic detail with smooth consistent motion, underwater lighting effects, and overwhelming sense of ancient alien menace.
