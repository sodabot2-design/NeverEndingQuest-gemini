  "plan": "Round 4, Ranger Thane (17) acts first, then Eirik (16 - player), then Shadow Relic (2). The player has declared their action out of turn, intending to cast Sacred Flame at the nearest enemy. HOLDING PATTERN: Acknowledge the intent, but first resolve Ranger Thane's turn using his two available attack rolls (CREATURE ATTACKS d20 [17] and [5]). Thane will likely attack the Shadow Relic, as the Shadow Manifestation is dead. After Thane's turn, it will be the player's (Eirik's) turn. At that point, prompt the player to confirm their intent to cast Sacred Flame at the Shadow Relic and request their d8 radiant damage roll (as Sacred Flame requires no attack roll, only a target DEX save). DO NOT process the player's Sacred Flame until it is actually their turn in the initiative order.",
  "narration": "As you gather the radiant power for Sacred Flame, Thane acts first, his instincts honed by countless battles. He nocks an arrow and lets it fly with deadly precision at the pulsing heart of the relic, then draws his shortsword and rushes in with a desperate slash. The air thrums with tension as the relic pulses menacingly.\n\nYou see the opening, holy fire gathering in your palm, but it is not yet your moment. The tide of battle shifts with every heartbeat.\n\nHold your spell at the ready—your turn is next, and the relic’s fate may hinge on your divine judgment.",
