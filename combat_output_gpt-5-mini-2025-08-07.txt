  "plan": "Round 4 mid-cycle. Initiative order: Ranger Thane (17) acted now -> Eirik Hearthwise (16) next -> Shadow Relic (2) last. Resolve only Ranger Thane's turn (marked with [>]). Defer the player's previously declared Sacred Flame (out-of-turn) until it is the player's actual turn. Update creature HP for damage dealt by Thane. Do NOT process Eirik or Shadow Relic yet. Await player's confirmation to cast Sacred Flame on their turn and have them roll their player dice (1d8 for Sacred Flame damage).",
  "narration": "You call out your intent to unleash Sacred Flame at the nearest enemy; I hear you and note your action, but Thane moves first.\n\nRanger Thane shoulders his longbow with a grim, practiced motion. The corrupted ranger narrows his eyes at the relic's writhing heart, draws, and releases—his arrow hissing through the thick air of the chamber. The missile finds a seam in the shadow substance, punching a glowing hole in the relic's surface. The blow rings with a small, iron note as the shadow recoils.\n\nThane follows up, closing for a quick melee strike—his shortsword flashes—but the shadow substance ripples and the blade slides away, biting only air.\n\nThe room stands taut, the dais still humming with old power. Scout Elen scrambles to her feet and breathes in the stale, charged air; Thane glances to you and grunts, ready to cover your ritual.\n\nThane's attacks resolved: he fires a longbow shot (d20 17 +7 = 24) that hits the Shadow Relic (AC 15) for 1d8 + 3 piercing damage. Using the NPC damage pool, that d8 is 2, so the arrow deals 5 piercing damage. The second attack (shortsword) is a miss (d20 5 +5 = 10 vs AC 15).\n\nTactical recap: Ranger Thane just acted and wounded the relic. Shadow Relic HP is now 29/52. Initiative: Ranger Thane (just acted) -> Eirik Hearthwise (your turn) -> Shadow Relic (waiting). You are at 29/47 HP, no conditions. The shadow cage is broken and Scout Elen is freed; the relic is wounded but still active and whispering. You were preparing to cast Sacred Flame at the nearest enemy (the Shadow Relic). Is that still your action? If so, confirm and roll 1d8 for your Sacred Flame damage now. After you give your damage roll, I will resolve the relic's Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) using the preroll and pause for a brief reaction before resolving the outcome.",
