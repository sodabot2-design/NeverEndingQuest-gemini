A long, flowing cloak billows softly behind him, embroidered with motifs of marine life that seem almost alive. At his side rests a gracefully curved scimitar, its hilt encrusted with iridescent shells, and a small satchel of alchemical vials hangs from his belt, hinting at his skill in potion-making.\n\nHis demeanor is approachable and disarming; he greets newcomers with a broad, genuine smile that reveals a row of slightly crooked teeth, making him seem more human than kingly. The warmth of his laughter echoes like distant waves crashing against rocks, and tales of his charm and humor circulate among villagers, drawing them to him. With a keen sense of loyalty and an adventurous spirit, The Drowned King is not only a protector of his realm but also a potential ally to those who seek the mysteries of the deep, eager to share his wisdom and bravery with worthy companions.",
