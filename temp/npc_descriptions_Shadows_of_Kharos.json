    "description": "**Brother Lintar**\n\nBrother Lintar stands at an unassuming height of about 5'8\", with a lean yet sturdy build that speaks to years spent traversing the rugged terrain of the Cursed Cliffs. His skin is a warm bronze, lightly weathered from exposure to salty winds, while his kind hazel eyes glimmer with wisdom and a hint of mischief. Silver streaks weave through his tousled, dark hair, which falls to his shoulders, often tied back with a simple leather cord. A well-groomed beard frames his face, lending him an air of both maturity and approachability.\n\nHe wears a flowing robe of deep maroon, adorned with intricate silver embroidery that depicts waves and stars--a nod to his affinity for the ocean and the night sky. The fabric is surprisingly well-kept, hinting at his dedication to his priestly duties despite the harsh surroundings. A simple silver pendant in the shape of a lighthouse hangs around his neck, suggesting a connection to the mystical beacon that once lit the cliffs.\n\nAt his side rests a sturdy wooden staff, adorned with seashells and soft blue lichen, its head crowned with a glowing crystal that radiates a gentle light. A small, leather satchel hangs from his belt, filled with herbs, healing potions, and scrolls containing ancient knowledge. \n\nBrother Lintar's demeanor is warm and welcoming, often breaking into a genuine smile that reveals a set of slightly crooked but charming teeth. His voice is soothing, capable of calming even the most restless spirit, and he possesses an innate ability to listen intently, making him a confidant and trusted ally. His deep empathy and unwavering sense of justice make him not just a capable companion, but a beacon of hope in the dark times of shadows and despair.",
