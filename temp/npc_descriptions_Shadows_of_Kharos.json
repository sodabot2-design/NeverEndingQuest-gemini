    "description": "**Character Description: Abbess Miralda**\n\nAbbess Miralda is a human woman in her late thirties, standing at a modest height of 5'6\", with a solid yet graceful build hinting at her years of toil and dedication to her community. Her sun-kissed skin is soft and warm, adorned with faint, intricate tattoos of protective sigils that wrap around her forearms, a testament to her spiritual journey. Miralda's deep green eyes sparkle with kindness and wisdom, framed by gentle lines that tell tales of laughter and hardship. Her long, chestnut hair, streaked with silver, falls in soft waves down her back, often partially pinned up with a simple silver clasp shaped like a crescent moon.\n\nDressed in a flowing robe of deep teal, accented with golden embroidery that resembles the waves of the sea, she embodies both grace and approachability. The fabric is pristine, with no signs of wear, suggesting her attention to both her appearance and her duties. A sturdy leather belt cinches her waist, from which dangle small pouches filled with herbs and trinkets, and a beautifully crafted wooden staff rests beside her, not drawn but at the ready, its top adorned with a glowing crystal that pulses gently.\n\nHer demeanor is warm and inviting, often punctuated by an easy smile that reveals her genuine desire to help those in need. Miralda possesses a nurturing spirit, combined with an unwavering resolve, making her a reliable ally in times of need. With a knack for storytelling and a love for sharing knowledge, she often engages her companions in thoughtful conversations, encouraging them to reflect on their own journeys. This blend of warmth, wisdom, and capability makes Abbess Miralda not only a potential ally but a cherished friend in the shadows of Kharos.",
