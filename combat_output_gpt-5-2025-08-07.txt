  "plan": "Round 4. Initiative order: Shadow Manifestation (dead), Ranger Thane (17) [CURRENT], Eirik (16) [NEXT], Shadow Relic (2). Player attempted an out-of-turn Sacred Flame; acknowledge and hold until their turn. Resolve Thane's full turn using prerolled attacks: Attack[17] hits AC 15, Attack[5] misses. Thane uses bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark on the Shadow Relic (expends 1st-level slot). Damage uses GENERIC d8 [2] -> 2+3=5 piercing (halved to 2), and GENERIC d6 [6] from Hunter's Mark (halved to 3). Total 5 damage; Relic HP 34 -> 29. After Thane, hand initiative to the player and STOP, confirming their intended Sacred Flame.",
  "narration": "You grit your teeth and ready a prayer, light gathering at your fingertips—held in check for the right moment.\n\nThane moves first. He plants his feet, whispers a harsh vow that crackles like dried leaves—Hunter’s Mark—and looses. The arrow streaks in, punching into the swirling heart of shadow; the relic recoils as darkness bleeds away in tatters. A second shaft screeches across the dais, but the relic flares, and the shot is hurled wide by a wave of force.\n\nThe chamber’s whispers rise to a hateful chorus as the relic writhes on the cusp of collapse. Elen clings to a pillar, eyes on you. Thane calls over the din, ‘Now, Eirik!’\n\nTactical recap: Thane just struck true and marked the relic. Shadow Relic reels at 29 of 52. Initiative: you are up now, then the relic acts. You’re 29 of 47 hit points, no conditions. The dais is clear; the nearest enemy is the Shadow Relic, which is vulnerable to radiant power.\n\nYou were ready to cast Sacred Flame at the nearest foe. Do you follow through and direct Sacred Flame at the Shadow Relic, or choose another action?",
